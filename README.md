# AI Playlist Generator

To use the playlist generator, an OpenAI API Key and a Spotify developer account would be required. The Spotify developer account will provide the 'client id' and 'client secret key', which are important to establish connection with the Spotify Web API.

Once the above requirements are met, execute the 'frontend.py' file.
